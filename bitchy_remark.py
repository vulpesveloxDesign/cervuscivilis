Do you like bonsai and animals? Why not have [the best of two worlds](https://www.ding.net/bonsaikitten/insertGray.jpg)?

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I've noticed that your post concerns itself with immigration.
We don't mean to make a fuzz, but if you're a new immigrant just trying to say hello, could you do us a huge favour and post your greeting in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Niceria/comments/ep3rah/new_immigrant_thread/) instead?
While we appreciate your enthusiasm greatly, we'd like to reserve the main page for announcements.

Thank you kindly, sorry for the inconvenience, and welcome to r/Niceria! We're so glad you're finally here! :)
